    <text start="0" dur="5.009">good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I&amp;#39;m
jones&amp;#39; media true and welcome to the</text>
    <text start="5.009" dur="3.991">descendant a little indie game that I
recently became aware of which is</text>
    <text start="9" dur="5.94">basically as I understand it like a
telltale style episodic narrative game</text>
    <text start="14.94" dur="7.56">but in a full-out story universe which
is such a good idea I don&amp;#39;t know when I</text>
    <text start="22.5" dur="2.41">was on it before the other thing about
this because I&amp;#39;ve been deliberately</text>
    <text start="24.91" dur="3.75">trying to avoid information about it is
like narrative absolute games the less</text>
    <text start="28.66" dur="3.599">you know the better in some ways is the
kind of go to jewel protected as</text>
    <text start="32.259" dur="4.271">thinking so badly broken age I guess
where one of your protagonist is</text>
    <text start="36.53" dur="3.959">investigating a vote that seems to have
gone dark about ageism is going horribly</text>
    <text start="40.489" dur="5">horribly wrong again very full out style
and the only character is earlier in</text>
    <text start="45.489" dur="5.561">time in vote in bed it days you&amp;#39;ve kind
of got the mystery unfolding in the</text>
    <text start="51.05" dur="4.62">aftermath of it but also what happened
during it and I&amp;#39;m very very excited and</text>
    <text start="55.67" dur="4.159">this looks really cool so let&amp;#39;s dive in
and see how this goes showering before</text>
    <text start="59.829" dur="5.961">the end of the world are a little bit
cell shaded it is all a little bit The</text>
    <text start="65.79" dur="3.52">Walking Dead visual style don&amp;#39;t you take
another step</text>
    <text start="71.48" dur="9.8">not who I was expecting the other guy
got reassigned I mean check your file HQ</text>
    <text start="81.28" dur="5.26">should have confirmed a few hours ago it
was even dressed in kind of vote blue</text>
    <text start="95.09" dur="7.16">is all very the only to fall out for its
the day the world ended things are</text>
    <text start="102.25" dur="7.619">getting nasty just outside our 01 20
years ago today scientists confirmed we</text>
    <text start="109.869" dur="3.971">could not reverse the damage done to the
climate officials announced they will</text>
    <text start="113.84" dur="8.819">present their greed and fear an inside
source destroyed our world continues as</text>
    <text start="122.659" dur="3.66">food supplies run short this is thought
to be the direct result of government</text>
    <text start="126.319" dur="5.28">officials announcing last week the food
rations would be destroyed it just</text>
    <text start="135.13" dur="4.49">peace talks between the three super
powers broke down left the world</text>
    <text start="139.62" dur="4.62">wondering what an immediate effects this
would have as tensions now rise to a new</text>
    <text start="144.24" dur="0.5">level</text>
    <text start="144.74" dur="8.34">never before experienced strong the
resource room</text>
    <text start="157.16" dur="2.43">no surprise</text>
    <text start="159.59" dur="3.88">there was only one thing</text>
    <text start="184.31" dur="8.27">aftermath centuries later in alaska
descendants remaining unknown</text>
    <text start="203.33" dur="3">from seven billion</text>
    <text start="243.56" dur="6.36">descendants of human rights reserved</text>
    <text start="250.94" dur="2.09">underground</text>
    <text start="253.03" dur="8.53">until the surface was safe centuries
past the surface became safe</text>
    <text start="263.05" dur="4.63">and their descendants began to rebuild</text>
    <text start="269.06" dur="3">1</text>
    <text start="276.38" dur="3">find out</text>
    <text start="282.08" dur="7.17">HQ this is search where it opens at a
gate ready to blow it off its hinges</text>
    <text start="289.25" dur="20.03">when you are dark 100 yes good good so
centuries after Mir how words through</text>
    <text start="309.28" dur="4.95">these doors we now follow admit it feels
like you&amp;#39;re going</text>
    <text start="316.18" dur="2.61">let&amp;#39;s just get this over with</text>
    <text start="318.79" dur="7.9">but if there was even a chance the
descendants or the genders watching over</text>
    <text start="326.69" dur="3">with</text>
    <text start="330.79" dur="9.34">HQ HQ this is search we&amp;#39;re past the
outer gate in the dissent among now yeah</text>
    <text start="340.95" dur="3">that</text>
    <text start="352.02" dur="7.299">expendable can be done expendable you
were flipping one of four thousand</text>
    <text start="359.319" dur="12.53">chosen to slow down or has let up know
randall slowdown cue remind Downey and</text>
    <text start="371.849" dur="3.921">we did take our time will get those to
send its out a set</text>
    <text start="377.33" dur="9.889">they&amp;#39;re good enough for you down</text>
    <text start="391.189" dur="5.73">obstacle standing between us another
hundred and eighty humanity&amp;#39;s finest</text>
    <text start="396.919" dur="5.671">turx so who&amp;#39;s this guy he must have been
important enough to be saved</text>
    <text start="402.59" dur="16.19">HQ HQ were at the inner gate please
advise HQ HQ do you copy I&amp;#39;ll see if I</text>
    <text start="418.78" dur="5.099">can get this long range radio just hurry
up as poor bastards have waited long</text>
    <text start="423.879" dur="6.03">enough to my parents will be an engineer
in that case I&amp;#39;m guessing so the way we</text>
    <text start="429.909" dur="5.01">move around as its kind of traditional
kind of traditional pointing clicky kind</text>
    <text start="434.919" dur="5.72">of stuff lovely I can I speak to this
guy just by Randalls trying to get the</text>
    <text start="440.639" dur="8.201">radio working yep you are very deep
underground in fact so you kind of look</text>
    <text start="448.84" dur="7.879">at things only here to tell everyone
safe to leave but still can&amp;#39;t help but</text>
    <text start="456.719" dur="3.031">feel unprepared it was a very curious
about what they were saying about</text>
    <text start="459.75" dur="5.069">Genesis janitors and descendants
adjusting well to my mind to send them</text>
    <text start="464.819" dur="4.65">to be the one surprisingly frozen the
janitors the ones you kind of were</text>
    <text start="469.469" dur="5.48">assigned to keep watch over them so
presumably the janitors would be frozen</text>
    <text start="474.949" dur="6.65">they were just part of a kind of parts
of the group that probably just had to</text>
    <text start="481.599" dur="6.271">breed repopulate as they went along so
that presumes do that to you to fix</text>
    <text start="487.87" dur="3.009">roads be qualified people that
scientists and so forth are still useful</text>
    <text start="490.879" dur="3.921">we gotta go toward self is able to see
if we can figure out anything about that</text>
    <text start="494.8" dur="5.119">last line of defense against the outside
world I need to hurry up and get it open</text>
    <text start="499.919" dur="5.11">big bucks over on this side that feels
like a good place to start looking over</text>
    <text start="505.029" dur="3.711">the vote panel thing we can do in here
you might be an engineer in like</text>
    <text start="508.74" dur="5.12">attrition or something like that and
access panels rusted shops</text>
    <text start="515.52" dur="9.4">a tool box right here and a crowbar
perfect at all 21 proba proba required</text>
    <text start="524.92" dur="5.13">lovely so yeah it&amp;#39;s kind of fairly
traditional old school adventure games</text>
    <text start="530.05" dur="5.34">dialogic point-and-click find things
interactive whiteboards probe are</text>
    <text start="535.39" dur="7.449">perfect for the computer however
requires ok well kinda but notice there</text>
    <text start="542.839" dur="5.011">is in fact a cable coming out of the
bottom of its heading over in this</text>
    <text start="547.85" dur="5.38">direction that we are warned generator
power fight we just turned on generator</text>
    <text start="553.23" dur="1.16">fuel tank is empty</text>
    <text start="554.39" dur="5.06">that&amp;#39;s ok I&amp;#39;ve got gasoline on my truck
I sort there earlier yep there&amp;#39;s and</text>
    <text start="559.45" dur="4.12">gasoline arrives in my trunk grab that
should be the generated turn on the</text>
    <text start="563.57" dur="4.85">computer perfect so you&amp;#39;re going to
generate a generation starts running</text>
    <text start="568.42" dur="5.35">nice to get computing going very very
nicely and then over here and see if we</text>
    <text start="573.77" dur="3.79">happen to know my country would know the
access code I would&amp;#39;ve been sent with</text>
    <text start="577.56" dur="3">the access right I think I got it</text>
    <text start="581.8" dur="5.44">you waiting for a written invitation
helmets on until we know what&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="587.24" dur="5.95">happening there we can&amp;#39;t take any
chances so just a quick simple</text>
    <text start="593.19" dur="7.31">introduction to how the game&amp;#39;s pointed
clicky inventory stuff works makes sense</text>
    <text start="600.5" dur="6.399">question is with me here at Cendant or
Janet up presumably had ascended to the</text>
    <text start="606.899" dur="7.56">100 unless of course they&amp;#39;re not
supposed to meet what the hell you</text>
    <text start="614.459" dur="4.791">waiting here senator we got no idea what
we walking into their you&amp;#39;re not exactly</text>
    <text start="619.25" dur="3.47">what I&amp;#39;m not exactly what</text>
    <text start="622.72" dur="7.57">and you&amp;#39;re not expendable your liability
in Austin plan you&amp;#39;re not expend pull</text>
    <text start="630.29" dur="5.649">your kind of important I guess one of
you don&amp;#39;t maybe even President people</text>
    <text start="635.939" dur="3">know you&amp;#39;re not exactly expended</text>
    <text start="644.2" dur="3">look for all we know it could be
dangerous</text>
    <text start="648.16" dur="3">long range radio worked up top right</text>
    <text start="652.67" dur="3.38">who the hell do you think you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
    <text start="656.05" dur="7.719">short-range radio on anything happens to
me you can get back to top side and</text>
    <text start="663.769" dur="8.26">contact page can argue that it is
incredibly Telltale Games not just with</text>
    <text start="672.029" dur="6.8">so and so will remember that all of that
stuff very very cool I like it I want to</text>
    <text start="678.829" dur="3.75">tell tell guide really wanted Telltale
Games sets in flipping the full album</text>
    <text start="682.579" dur="6.111">that&amp;#39;s fantastic so now just head over
here service not working I&amp;#39;m guessing</text>
    <text start="688.69" dur="5.49">service elevator was to be used to be
worth checking out before we get the</text>
    <text start="694.18" dur="1.34">hell outta here</text>
    <text start="695.52" dur="5.72">ok but apparently not just yet for now
the priority is find our way down now</text>
    <text start="701.24" dur="6.14">assign ashamed forced their way into the
wrong arc yep that&amp;#39;s what we apparently</text>
    <text start="707.38" dur="6.97">want to go the only person we know who
was here so I gotta wait out here</text>
    <text start="714.35" dur="3.39">however long it takes to confirm the
facility safe</text>
    <text start="719.07" dur="6.63">frozen for centuries what&amp;#39;s another hour
whatever gets the descendants out of</text>
    <text start="725.7" dur="9.67">here and the genders to priority giant
is exactly presumably janitors are still</text>
    <text start="735.37" dur="6.37">people cannot yet contravene the door
after getting into the facility it was</text>
    <text start="741.74" dur="3.66">meant to be easy to find the Arts
generators</text>
    <text start="753.5" dur="11.12">and his mystery for the same walkway
into you back to what was your little</text>
    <text start="764.62" dur="6.62">clipboard you been here long couple of
days can thinks that almost everyone</text>
    <text start="771.24" dur="4.3">gets chosen sorry to hear how many
descendants are allocated here we got a</text>
    <text start="775.54" dur="5.29">hundred days so far this facility is
something I believe me it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
    <text start="780.83" dur="4.25">one of the government&amp;#39;s most advanced
underground bunkers you know once they</text>
    <text start="785.08" dur="2.12">finish building it</text>
    <text start="787.2" dur="5.03">face it&amp;#39;s a work in progress by the time
the construction team were done up name</text>
    <text start="792.23" dur="4.2">this place is gonna be like something
from the future even the system</text>
    <text start="796.43" dur="7.42">monitoring this place the equations are
so advanced its Shiite sorry I totally</text>
    <text start="803.85" dur="3.06">forgot I&amp;#39;m Silas</text>
    <text start="806.91" dur="6.17">same as you decision says my duty to
keep the descendants alive and well I</text>
    <text start="813.08" dur="5.14">mean but you already knew that what
about you what&amp;#39;s your area of expertise</text>
    <text start="818.22" dur="6.52">and general mechanics with engineering
electrical engineering electrical</text>
    <text start="824.74" dur="7.37">engineering because that sounds cooler
me electrical engineering I guess your</text>
    <text start="832.11" dur="5.35">job then we&amp;#39;ll be looking after the art
itself it&amp;#39;s a big responsibility</text>
    <text start="838.8" dur="5.48">never thought I&amp;#39;d grow up to be a
janitor yeah that makes two of us</text>
    <text start="845.939" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s ok</text>
    <text start="851.01" dur="6.27">a fault lines we should expect sometimes
this place has been built to stand up to</text>
    <text start="857.28" dur="7.22">anything and everything Mother Nature
can throw the ball dropping this is</text>
    <text start="864.5" dur="8.13">really happening now this isn&amp;#39;t an
earthquake are those explosions gotta go</text>
    <text start="872.63" dur="8.81">now to write yeah I made sure full slate
used eight safe and sound</text>
    <text start="882.58" dur="9.64">manatees so-called finest sacrifices you
janitors made safeguarding the next</text>
    <text start="892.22" dur="2.28">chapter of the human race</text>
    <text start="894.5" dur="9.15">well i dnt you the people like you are
he just went full politician already had</text>
    <text start="903.65" dur="5.33">a habit of speaking like you rehearsed
it just like you rehearse for a</text>
    <text start="908.98" dur="6.17">politician so both menial janet is that
means I was born inside whenever I was</text>
    <text start="915.15" dur="4.46">part of me when she checked into our
kwan well she just thought she was hit</text>
    <text start="919.61" dur="3.38">kind of take care of it but it wasn&amp;#39;t
actually especially those rising outside</text>
    <text start="922.99" dur="3.69">cause the resource water on she didn&amp;#39;t
know the bombs or bomb just happened to</text>
    <text start="926.68" dur="4.8">fall just after she got inside by
coincidence case or telling the</text>
    <text start="931.48" dur="4">two-story simultaneously very cool the
question then would be open Wednesday</text>
    <text start="935.48" dur="5.11">presumably turnaround wilson et
hammering presumably men must be long</text>
    <text start="940.59" dur="6.98">dead she wasn&amp;#39;t jesse was a job that
would logically me she was living</text>
    <text start="947.57" dur="3.72">centers passing the must have just been
a breeding program that could in the</text>
    <text start="951.29" dur="5.83">market so keep your janet is coming
along I guess and he must have big water</text>
    <text start="957.889" dur="4.66">generations from his office and she was
the first generation of hers are you</text>
    <text start="962.549" dur="6.08">know some access card or everything&amp;#39;s
power down the art systems are still</text>
    <text start="968.629" dur="6.18">running right seems that way as I find
the janitors quarters if anyone&amp;#39;s home</text>
    <text start="974.809" dur="9.95">to shore with around here that go
through that just just one of those</text>
    <text start="984.759" dur="8.35">anything else round history that way all
bunch supplies nothing around here so we</text>
    <text start="993.109" dur="8.051">got a better camera around here no just
that one tour in that so yeah I&amp;#39;m kinda</text>
    <text start="1001.16" dur="5.079">curious to get me is take being a
janitor is not just saw detention area</text>
    <text start="1006.239" dur="2.111">joke she has signed up to</text>
    <text start="1008.35" dur="9.569">she&amp;#39;s expected to breed new janet is
coming in position one door there around</text>
    <text start="1017.919" dur="5.681">here that there&amp;#39;s a first aid kit I know
kind of truck that just another door</text>
    <text start="1023.6" dur="3">randall you read me</text>
    <text start="1027.86" dur="1.229">find them</text>
    <text start="1029.089" dur="8.95">see that the window ok back to mir in
that case what happened the day the</text>
    <text start="1038.039" dur="4.071">bombs fell three years after the world
lenders</text>
    <text start="1043.579" dur="11.431">quarters underage descendants remain ok
so the descendants were indeed so they</text>
    <text start="1055.01" dur="7.669">were frozen still just a short-term
basis and hibernation sicknesses</text>
    <text start="1062.679" dur="7.651">apparently not on the way she used to
anesthetic compound sickness sets aside</text>
    <text start="1070.33" dur="3.599">time ok</text>
    <text start="1075.67" dur="8.12">it&amp;#39;s been three years</text>
    <text start="1087.04" dur="3.97">you should check the maintenance logs on
the computer parker takes on the open</text>
    <text start="1091.01" dur="1.67">when something needs to be fixed</text>
    <text start="1092.68" dur="3">we need to figure out what it is</text>
    <text start="1096.82" dur="2.19">check the maintenance logs got it</text>
    <text start="1099.01" dur="5.98">give her a second on the ground so he
said Genesis were frozen to it&amp;#39;s just</text>
    <text start="1104.99" dur="3.86">that the descendants themselves were
kept locked away</text>
    <text start="1109.78" dur="4.24">kind of without question to the earth
was ready but the Genesis that things</text>
    <text start="1114.02" dur="4.92">kind of pushed open the moment anything
went wrong it was automated system it</text>
    <text start="1118.94" dur="3.79">risky but I guess it&amp;#39;s a little bit less
weird than hiring engineers and saying</text>
    <text start="1122.73" dur="3.94">by the way you can send to be better off
with someone so you can produce baby so</text>
    <text start="1126.67" dur="4.99">they can be more Genesis that&amp;#39;s my
crying tank good ol cried tank being in</text>
    <text start="1131.66" dur="4.26">that quiet take it felt like I just
blinked I guess I&amp;#39;ll get used to it</text>
    <text start="1135.92" dur="5.78">someday she stepped in the tank and that
it was just three years later a moment</text>
    <text start="1141.7" dur="4.16">later I go to the bathroom clean myself
up a bit good bathroom you&amp;#39;ve got this</text>
    <text start="1145.86" dur="4.4">rather lovely little shower cubicle here
and they keep doing something on sale</text>
    <text start="1150.26" dur="4.25">ever go to the bathroom at least it was
near by bathroom idea but it looks like</text>
    <text start="1154.51" dur="3.02">right now at least for the moment
nothing would need to do that in this</text>
    <text start="1157.53" dur="1.93">bill shouted</text>
    <text start="1159.46" dur="4.07">also closes on Sunday 21 just going to
be no step into the shower and use it</text>
    <text start="1163.53" dur="4.68">when that doors right now clearly has a
window and it&amp;#39;s alright fine I guess the</text>
    <text start="1168.21" dur="5.08">menu is gonna be pretty basic for a
while a whole bunch of emergency rations</text>
    <text start="1173.29" dur="5.63">over on the shelf that this store we
cannot go through least there&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="1178.92" dur="4.16">something to do during downtime so the
implication seems to be gentle might be</text>
    <text start="1183.08" dur="5.38">expected potentially for long periods to
just hang around and read books and</text>
    <text start="1188.46" dur="0.49">stuff</text>

    <text start="1407.49" dur="5.55">given the site is water leaking I&amp;#39;m
guessing ok but if it was going on here</text>
    <text start="1413.04" dur="5.9">and these are interact well but I&amp;#39;m
guessing the corridor that school of</text>
    <text start="1418.94" dur="4">drips and water is probably where things
have gone a bit wrong yep that was like</text>
    <text start="1422.94" dur="3.72">things have been a bit wrong motives
behind the yellow lights on the dripping</text>
    <text start="1426.66" dur="3.78">water I can&amp;#39;t find anything in this area
under different way up because none of</text>

the first big drama unraveling in front</text>
    <text start="1471.57" dur="4.27">of us only think I&amp;#39;m going to call this
a part here because this is one of those</text>
    <text start="1475.84" dur="4.78">big kind of narrative games and when
it&amp;#39;s a big story narrative episodic game</text>
    <text start="1480.62" dur="5.51">the polite thing to the death is to give
a good opportunity for you guys to go</text>
    <text start="1486.13" dur="3.86">and check this out if you&amp;#39;re interested
before a show the whole thing that just</text>
    <text start="1489.99" dur="3.9">kind of place special linear narrative
games of this I do not not showing too</text>
    <text start="1493.89" dur="5.51">much in the first part of this did
indeed launched today it is available</text>

description below tomorrow I will put up</text>
    <text start="1504.24" dur="4.51">the remainder of the first episode but
if you are looking for a new kind of</text>
    <text start="1508.75" dur="4.99">narrative episode of sorts of story game
in the style of telltale to kind of get</text>
    <text start="1513.74" dur="3.63">into you could probably do worse than
this from what I&amp;#39;ve seen so far the</text>
    <text start="1517.37" dur="4.429">voice work seems pretty good the graphic
seemed pretty decent I&amp;#39;m interested in</text>
    <text start="1521.799" dur="4.031">the current study they&amp;#39;ve been
relatively well characterized loving</text>
    <text start="1525.83" dur="3.82">citizens yeah I would potentially be
interested in seeing a little bit less</text>
    <text start="1529.65" dur="3.57">depending on how the rest is observed
goes I might well decide subsequent to</text>
    <text start="1533.22" dur="4.329">go on to look at the subsequent episodes
as they emerged just because there&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="1537.549" dur="0.691">nothing else</text>
    <text start="1538.24" dur="5.049">fallout is too good for me to know so I
will finish off is observed tomorrow</text>
