    <text start="12.099" dur="4.12">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male presenter: All right good afternoon
everyone. Today Pawnee&amp;#39;s finest comes to our</text>
    <text start="16.219" dur="5.371">Los Angeles office for a Talks at Google presentation.
We&amp;#39;ve rolled out the Tom Haverfoods in our</text>
    <text start="21.59" dur="5.3">café, including waffles, all the bacon and
eggs we could have. Unfortunately, we&amp;#39;re still</text>
    <text start="26.89" dur="4.91">working on a way to integrate the Ron Swanson
Turkey Burger into our nutritional guidelines.</text>
    <text start="31.8" dur="4.989">But research is still ongoing there. But now
we&amp;#39;re really ready to treat yourself. We have</text>
    <text start="36.789" dur="4.36">four amazing members of the Parks and Rec
crew here today to talk about their new season,</text>
    <text start="41.149" dur="6">season 5, which starts on September 20 on
NBC Thursdays. We have Amy Poehler, Adam Scott,</text>
    <text start="47.149" dur="4.401">Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza in essence the
cutest couples from the show.</text>
    <text start="51.55" dur="3.039">[Applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Presenter Please join me in welcoming Parks</text>
    <text start="54.589" dur="6.49">and Rec to Google.
[applause and cheering]</text>
    <text start="61.079" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy Poehler: Hi, everybody how you doing?
Thank you for having us. My name is Amy Poehler</text>
    <text start="75.049" dur="6.541">I&amp;#39;m with Adam Scott, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt.
We make up part of the cast of Parks and Recreation.</text>
    <text start="81.59" dur="7">We&amp;#39;re so happy we could join you here today.
We should say welcome to the the Parks and</text>
    <text start="89.56" dur="4.82">Recreation&amp;#39;s Google talk and it&amp;#39;s going to
last about an hour and then we will participate</text>
    <text start="94.38" dur="3.909">in a Google hangout after that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam Scott: Is that just where we just</text>
    <text start="98.289" dur="1.911">hang out? [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah, we&amp;#39;re just going to hang out.</text>
    <text start="100.2" dur="2.36">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Like super cas- stuff?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Right, if it all goes well it may</text>
    <text start="102.56" dur="4.69">turn into a Google make out. [laughter] Where
we let people come up and make out with us.</text>
    <text start="107.25" dur="5.5">[laughter] And then, then there&amp;#39;s going to
be Google sex, [laughter] which is self-explanatory</text>
    <text start="112.75" dur="3.619">and then a Google walk of shame.
[laughter]</text>
    <text start="116.369" dur="3.17">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: And then a Google morning after
pill?</text>
    <text start="119.539" dur="3.95">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s right. A morning after pill.
[laughter] That&amp;#39;s right.</text>
    <text start="123.489" dur="6.08">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: But if that doesn&amp;#39;t work
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Then it&amp;#39;ll be a Google, Google &amp;#39;why</text>
    <text start="129.569" dur="7">isn&amp;#39;t the audience calling me back?&amp;#39; [laughter]
I would like to say that Michael Schur the</text>
    <text start="136.81" dur="3.56">creator of Parks and Recreation was supposed
to be here, and unfortunately he could not</text>
    <text start="140.37" dur="5.6">make it. He was working really hard on our
next script. It&amp;#39;s very, very complicated and</text>
    <text start="145.97" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s sorry he can&amp;#39;t be here, but he wants
you to know that he&amp;#39;s working very hard and</text>
    <text start="150.08" dur="6.47">it&amp;#39;s tough work because we are entering into
season 5, the Rise of the Dragons. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="156.55" dur="6.77">Which is what we&amp;#39;re working on now. OK, so
we are gonna, I am going ask you guys questions</text>
    <text start="163.32" dur="3.74">like I don&amp;#39;t really know you, I guess.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: OK, Hi I&amp;#39;m Adam.</text>
    <text start="167.06" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Hey, nice to meet you. [laughter]
Those kind of stuff those kind of cool handshakes</text>
    <text start="176.02" dur="7">we do on set. First of all, you all look very
young and nice. This is being broadcast on</text>
    <text start="187.2" dur="2.97">the internet.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I was going to ask what the hell</text>
    <text start="190.17" dur="5.54">this was.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah this is a thing that&amp;#39;s on the</text>
    <text start="195.71" dur="5.43">internet and then people all over the world
will be able to download it. That&amp;#39;s exciting.</text>
    <text start="201.14" dur="3.64">You guys are drinking beer.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Yeah, my sponsor doesn&amp;#39;t even know</text>
    <text start="204.78" dur="4.539">how to use the internet, so. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I&amp;#39;m his sponsor.</text>
    <text start="209.319" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK, so lets get started and then we&amp;#39;ll
go into questions from the audience and then</text>
    <text start="218.59" dur="2.31">I guess eventually from the internet at some
point.</text>
    <text start="220.9" dur="4.58">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Oh great! Because we are at Google
and this is where the internet was invented,</text>
    <text start="225.48" dur="2.05">technically. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s right. Technically. And I don&amp;#39;t</text>
    <text start="227.53" dur="3.76">really know how it works but I think people
at home get to just yell their question into</text>
    <text start="231.29" dur="2.68">their computer and then it pops up into our
brains.</text>
    <text start="233.97" dur="3.21">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Whoa!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: So if you yell loud enough, it just</text>
    <text start="237.18" dur="1.27">goes straight to our brains?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah.</text>
    <text start="238.45" dur="3.68">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: That&amp;#39;s crazy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I know, it&amp;#39;s amazing. I mean guys</text>
    <text start="242.13" dur="3.48">the information highway is just.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: It&amp;#39;s straight to our brains.</text>
    <text start="245.61" dur="5.15">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: This is the future. No hover boards,
but they got this.</text>
    <text start="250.76" dur="6.24">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Actually I saw they&amp;#39;re not making
hover boards here.</text>
    <text start="257" dur="7">[Laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Just backpedaled on that. OK, guys!</text>
    <text start="265.759" dur="4.241">I&amp;#39;m hoping that most of the people here have
watched Parks and Recreation or have seen</text>
    <text start="270" dur="2.09">it.
[Applause and cheering]</text>
    <text start="272.09" dur="5.76">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Thank you. And the writers have done
an amazing job of creating real characters,</text>
    <text start="277.85" dur="5.22">seemingly real crazy characters. So one of
the things that people like about Parks is</text>
    <text start="283.07" dur="4.99">how much characters grow, the characters grow
over time. Where do you see your characters</text>
    <text start="288.06" dur="2.38">in 10 years?
[Laughter]</text>
    <text start="290.44" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: There&amp;#39;s no one else on the end, Pratt.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Is it my, is it for me?</text>
    <text start="298.84" dur="3.89">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Sure for all of us, for all of us.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Ten years from now?</text>
    <text start="302.73" dur="2.35">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: From ten years ago.</text>
    <text start="305.08" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: OK, I was going to say. I don&amp;#39;t
know if that meant. Well, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure</text>
    <text start="314.73" dur="4.92">I just don&amp;#39;t want any spoilers, spoiler alerts
because ten years from now there will still</text>
    <text start="319.65" dur="5.63">be Parks and Recreation on the air and you&amp;#39;ll
just have to tune in.</text>
    <text start="325.28" dur="3.52">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Alright, good. I would do this job
for another ten years.</text>
    <text start="328.8" dur="1.75">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Oh my God. Please let us do it for
ten more years. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="330.55" dur="5.339">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Please let the show for 15 years.
15 seasons. [laughing] I want to be like the</text>
    <text start="335.889" dur="5.971">Simpsons of mockumentary comedy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: By the way, in ten years, television</text>
    <text start="341.86" dur="3.71">shows will be beamed directly in your brain.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s right, you won&amp;#39;t even need</text>
    <text start="345.57" dur="2.84">a screen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: We won&amp;#39;t even need to act them out.</text>
    <text start="348.41" dur="3.439">We&amp;#39;ll just, notions of what we want to do
will go to the brains of the audience.</text>
    <text start="351.849" dur="2.591">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Ooh, I like that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah so we can do it from our houses.</text>
    <text start="354.44" dur="4">Because we&amp;#39;ll be so sick of each other anyway,
it&amp;#39;ll be great. We can just sit in our houses</text>
    <text start="358.44" dur="3.48">and think about our characters.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: [giggling] And then theater will just</text>
    <text start="361.92" dur="7">be that you stick you hand in like a jelly
and you&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;Broadway&amp;quot;! [laughter]</text>
    <text start="370.46" dur="4.7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Does anyone else want to talk about
their character in ten years or should I move</text>
    <text start="375.16" dur="5.41">on? Plaza?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: I think, that April and Andy will</text>
    <text start="380.57" dur="5.069">still be married.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Assuming we survive the zombie apocalypse.</text>
    <text start="385.639" dur="3.311">[Amy cracks up}
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Right. I think we&amp;#39;ll have five</text>
    <text start="388.95" dur="4.36">kids and
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Five in ten years?</text>
    <text start="393.31" dur="3.17">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I like that.</text>
    <text start="396.48" dur="5.82">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Quintuplets. They&amp;#39;ll all be nine
years old, in ten years. She&amp;#39;s pregnant with</text>
    <text start="402.3" dur="5.839">five kids right now. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: I want that. I think April should</text>
    <text start="408.139" dur="4.161">be pregnant soon and have multiple fetuses.
[laughter]</text>
    <text start="412.3" dur="3.99">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s a question, that&amp;#39;s actually
a question that some, coming down, I don&amp;#39;t</text>
    <text start="416.29" dur="2.73">know if we could do it during the talk, I
think, I don&amp;#39;t know if we could only do it</text>
    <text start="419.02" dur="1.769">during the hangout.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah.</text>
    <text start="420.789" dur="4.011">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: But there&amp;#39;s a question about April
getting pregnant in the hangout, so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
    <text start="424.8" dur="7">curious about that question hangout in the
hangout. OK, which, yes, go ahead Adam, sorry.</text>
    <text start="432.79" dur="5.219">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I would hope Leslie and Ben are still
dating in ten years, don&amp;#39;t you?</text>
    <text start="438.009" dur="3.13">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah I would think so.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: And I would hope that they&amp;#39;re still</text>
    <text start="441.139" dur="1.861">very busy.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yes.</text>
    <text start="443" dur="4.18">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Whether living in Washington, DC,
together, or in Pawnee together.</text>
    <text start="447.18" dur="3.72">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: That&amp;#39;s all I have to say. Sorry.</text>
    <text start="450.9" dur="6.51">[laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I liked your intense eye contact during</text>
    <text start="457.41" dur="2.45">that. It was good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I did.</text>
    <text start="459.86" dur="3.69">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK, speaking of intense eye contact
and intensity, which actor on our cast would</text>
    <text start="463.55" dur="5.489">win in an no holds barred fight? And which
character would win?</text>
    <text start="469.039" dur="4.031">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Nick Offerman and Ron Swanson.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah.</text>
    <text start="473.07" dur="6.5">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Without question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Nick has a really good sense of fighting.</text>
    <text start="479.57" dur="5.909">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: And this low center of gravity. I</text>
    <text start="485.479" dur="4.97">do think that maybe Jerry would kill everyone
though. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="490.449" dur="3.411">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: But that&amp;#39;d be more like a office
machine gun type.</text>
    <text start="493.86" dur="3.85">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: With like a machine gun? Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I feel like Jerry is one season away</text>
    <text start="497.71" dur="3.769">from walking in there with a submachine gun
[Amy cracks up] and just taking everybody</text>
    <text start="501.479" dur="4.951">out. Not Jim, but Jerry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Not Jim, very different.</text>
    <text start="506.43" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Jim is two seasons away. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK guys! Leslie&amp;#39;s person that&amp;#39;s like</text>
    <text start="514.229" dur="7">her, you know, her like dream person to have
sex with is obviously Joe Biden. Who would</text>
    <text start="523" dur="4.819">your characters, who was your, do you think
is your character&amp;#39;s person?</text>
    <text start="527.819" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Bill Pullman!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Amy: Bill Pullman! [laughs] Sure, yes</text>
    <text start="535.72" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: I think April was a really big
fan of his work in Casper when he played Devon</text>
    <text start="542.949" dur="7">Sawa&amp;#39;s dad. [laughter] All of her friends
like Devon Sawa but she liked Bill Pullman.</text>
    <text start="550.249" dur="3.741">[laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I see that.</text>
    <text start="553.99" dur="5.87">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Boy that&amp;#39;s, I would say for a long
time it was the lead singer of Rush until</text>
    <text start="559.86" dur="7">Andy found out it was a man. [laughter] He&amp;#39;s
still high on the list [Amy cracks up] but</text>
    <text start="573.18" dur="7">probably the Tracy Chapman. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Absolutely!</text>
    <text start="581.31" dur="4.779">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Because their singing voices are</text>
    <text start="586.089" dur="4.271">so similar.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Andy&amp;#39;s and Tracy Chapman&amp;#39;s?</text>
    <text start="590.36" dur="3.18">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: My personal singing voice
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: And Tracy Chapman&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="593.54" dur="4.82">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: And Tracy Chapman&amp;#39;s. Every time
I really actually, this is true, just sing,</text>
    <text start="598.36" dur="2.959">you know? Sometimes you just throw the gloves
off when you sing. Exactly like Tracy Chapman.</text>
    <text start="601.319" dur="3.921">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Amy: Real singing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I wonder if we could hear a little</text>
    <text start="605.24" dur="4.309">of that like right now?
[Cheers and applause]</text>
    <text start="609.549" dur="4.6">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Man, I&amp;#39;ll do it. But here&amp;#39;s the
thing. It&amp;#39;s going to be, I&amp;#39;m going to be vulnerable</text>
    <text start="614.149" dur="5.94">because because I&amp;#39;m not doing a bit, I&amp;#39;m really
singing my heart out. And I sound like Tracy</text>
    <text start="620.089" dur="0.631">Chapman.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Of course. Of course. Yeah, no, well</text>
    <text start="620.72" dur="2.96">look Google talks about being vulnerable,
number one. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="623.68" dur="3.139">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: OK. True.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Number two real singing is a real</text>
    <text start="626.819" dur="3.62">thing and when you have to really sing and
you don&amp;#39;t do a jokey sing, it&amp;#39;s very, very</text>
    <text start="630.439" dur="1.011">scary.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Yeah.</text>
    <text start="631.45" dur="5.119">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: It&amp;#39;s where you learn a lot about yourself.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: True. I have to take some courage.</text>
    <text start="636.569" dur="4.08">[laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK, everybody close their eyes.</text>
    <text start="640.649" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: [Singing] I drove a fast car, sounds
like Tracy Chapman when I sing.</text>
    <text start="649.66" dur="3.549">[Applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Thanks, Thanks guys.</text>
    <text start="653.209" dur="5.31">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: What about Ben? What&amp;#39;s his, who&amp;#39;s
his fantasy?</text>
    <text start="658.519" dur="5.801">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Janel Moloney from the West Wing.
[Laughing]</text>
    <text start="664.32" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s so specific and so true. OK.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: What about?</text>
    <text start="672.25" dur="2.779">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Oh Leslie&amp;#39;s is Joe Biden.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Oh right.</text>
    <text start="675.029" dur="5.04">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah, yeah. But I think she has a
thing for Daniel Craig a little bit</text>
    <text start="680.069" dur="2.56">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yep.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: We&amp;#39;ve said she has a Daniel Craig</text>
    <text start="682.629" dur="7">shaped body pillow. [laughter] And who else?
She probably wouldn&amp;#39;t kick Sam Waterson out</text>
    <text start="694.379" dur="6.161">of bed or something like that. [laughs] I&amp;#39;m
trying to think who she likes. OK, what&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="700.54" dur="7">the most surprising line or a story that you&amp;#39;ve
been given yet in the season. Like, or is</text>
    <text start="709.17" dur="5.529">there, is there a surprising moment you got
that you were like, without spoiling anything</text>
    <text start="714.699" dur="2.83">that you you&amp;#39;re nodding your head that you&amp;#39;re
of something.</text>
    <text start="717.529" dur="3.29">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: This season?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Well, we don&amp;#39;t want to spoil anything</text>
    <text start="720.819" dur="4.38">this season, I guess, I don&amp;#39;t&amp;#39; know. But if
there&amp;#39;s a way you could say it without spoiling</text>
    <text start="725.199" dur="7">it, yes. Or like, I&amp;#39;ll offer this in season,
I forget which one it was, Leslie, you find</text>
    <text start="736.009" dur="4.39">out Leslie&amp;#39;s like kind of a hoarder, like
you go to her house and her stuff, her house</text>
    <text start="740.399" dur="6.49">was filled to the capacity with books and
papers and I thought that was interesting</text>
    <text start="746.889" dur="6.771">character trait. And I was like &amp;quot;OK! OK! This
is who she is. This is the love setting, but</text>
    <text start="753.66" dur="4.33">nobody&amp;#39;s perfect.&amp;quot; Anybody else have anything
like that that they were given.</text>
    <text start="757.99" dur="5.209">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: There&amp;#39;s so many things like that,
I mean, I think Mike and all the writers make</text>
    <text start="763.199" dur="4">it a point to surprise the audience and that
will, often times, surprises us. I remember</text>
    <text start="767.199" dur="7">I was surprised in the wedding episode, where
when Andy was like the smallest sibling among</text>
    <text start="775.069" dur="4.07">all of his brothers. Like, he&amp;#39;d been picked
on and pushed around like a little twerp his</text>
    <text start="779.139" dur="5.44">whole life by these dudes who are like 6&amp;#39;8”
and 6&amp;#39;10”. That was surprising.</text>
    <text start="784.579" dur="3.281">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That was really, that was great detail.
Didn&amp;#39;t really make the show, a lot got cut</text>
    <text start="787.86" dur="2.8">out, but when you were getting married to
April, your brothers were there and the whole</text>
    <text start="790.66" dur="4.279">time they were just pushing you. And punching
you in the balls while you were getting married.</text>
    <text start="794.939" dur="2.781">[laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I couldn&amp;#39;t get enough of watching</text>
    <text start="797.72" dur="4.679">you guys just like horsing around during the
wedding ceremony. It was really funny.</text>
    <text start="802.399" dur="1.29">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: [laughs] It was fun.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: [laughing] Really funny.</text>
    <text start="803.689" dur="5.63">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: That&amp;#39;s right, you sometimes forget,
being on this show, because we shoot so much</text>
    <text start="809.319" dur="4.76">stuff, a lot of which doesn&amp;#39;t make it to air,
because our episodes, half hour comedy, 21</text>
    <text start="814.079" dur="6.01">and a half minutes, you know, with commercials.
We shoot maybe sometimes 38, 40 pages and</text>
    <text start="820.089" dur="5.581">that should make for about 40 minutes episode.
So a lot of really great stuff ends up not</text>
    <text start="825.67" dur="6.069">being shown on TV and so we have this idea
of all this stuff, but you forget that the</text>
    <text start="831.739" dur="4.08">audience members might not know all that stuff.
I was really surprised that they actually</text>
    <text start="835.819" dur="4.3">went, that we actually went to the Grand Canyon
to shoot the Grand Canyon rather than just</text>
    <text start="840.119" dur="6.75">shoot it in front of a blue screen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Plazie?</text>
    <text start="846.869" dur="5.46">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: I don&amp;#39;t know. I think for April
it&amp;#39;s always surprising when she cares about</text>
    <text start="852.329" dur="7">anything. [laughter] Or anyone. Which I like
those moments because you, I kind of, I feel</text>
    <text start="860.79" dur="6.399">like I have two or three episodes where I&amp;#39;m
kind of, where she kind of just wreaks havoc</text>
    <text start="867.189" dur="4.031">and doesn&amp;#39;t care and then all of a sudden
there&amp;#39;s like an episode where all of a sudden</text>
    <text start="871.22" dur="7">she&amp;#39;s being really nice to Chris Traeger and,
like, little, little glimpses of warm mushy</text>
    <text start="880.35" dur="5.25">stuff comes through and I like that. And she
really likes animals.</text>
    <text start="885.6" dur="4.479">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s right, she does like animals.
She loves them, she&amp;#39;s good with them.</text>
    <text start="890.079" dur="3.5">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: She&amp;#39;s really good with the animals.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: What about you Adam, what about Ben?</text>
    <text start="893.579" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I don&amp;#39;t know maybe his, the, his
love of Claymation was a big [laughter] is</text>
    <text start="905.379" dur="4.71">really great. Like when you read these things
you have no idea what&amp;#39;s coming down the pike</text>
    <text start="910.089" dur="3.65">and so you get this script and you read these
hilarious things they write for you [chuckles]</text>
    <text start="913.739" dur="5.11">and it kind of opens up this whole other world
to the character. It&amp;#39;s really funny.</text>
    <text start="918.849" dur="2.77">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: You have a proclivity for depression.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah, yeah.</text>
    <text start="921.619" dur="1.53">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Ben, Ben does, Ben can go kind of
dark.</text>
    <text start="923.149" dur="4.73">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: He&amp;#39;s spins out if things just kind
of change a little bit and so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
    <text start="927.879" dur="4.49">fun, it&amp;#39;s really funny.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Adam was dressed on set one time in</text>
    <text start="932.369" dur="3.9">Ben&amp;#39;s depressed clothes and I was like &amp;quot;hey!&amp;quot;
And he was like &amp;quot;Hey.&amp;quot; Like I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
    <text start="936.269" dur="2.46">know he was wearing depressing clothes as
his character.</text>
    <text start="938.729" dur="2.73">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: It wasn&amp;#39;t until later that you realized
it was my wardrobe.</text>
    <text start="941.459" dur="5.36">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I was like &amp;quot;Oh you are wearing Doc
Martins and a Letters to Cleo t-shirt. Those</text>
    <text start="946.819" dur="6.721">aren&amp;#39;t your clothes from home?”
OK, and why don&amp;#39;t we explain, some people</text>
    <text start="953.54" dur="4.079">want to know what a typical day is like on
set. Like a typical week or a typical day.</text>
    <text start="957.619" dur="5.27">Can you guys explain that at all for people
who want to know what it&amp;#39;s like working on</text>
    <text start="962.889" dur="3.75">Parks?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Well it depends on who you talk</text>
    <text start="966.639" dur="7">to, but for us, at least for me, it&amp;#39;s real
easy. [laughter] Fucking awesome. It&amp;#39;s great.</text>
    <text start="979.23" dur="5.629">Typical day, 11 o clock rolls around I&amp;#39;m like,
&amp;quot;Oh God, I got to go to work in two hours.&amp;quot;</text>
    <text start="984.859" dur="7">[laughter] Walk down the hill, seven minutes
to get to work. Show up, park in a spot right</text>
    <text start="992.559" dur="5.46">next to, like, a trailer, kind of like the
one I grew up in, but a little bigger. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="998.019" dur="5.22">Go in there, hang out for a while, someone
will knock on the door &amp;quot;Hey Chris, they&amp;#39;re</text>
    <text start="1003.239" dur="4.07">ready for you in hair and makeup.&amp;quot; That usually
means in about 20 minutes I&amp;#39;m going to come</text>
    <text start="1007.309" dur="4.46">out. Go get my hair done. [Amy cracks up]
No, it&amp;#39;s really fun. Our crew works really</text>
    <text start="1011.769" dur="5.49">hard, so it really depends on who you ask.
Because the people who, on the crew, will</text>
    <text start="1017.259" dur="5.591">work 60 hours a week and so for them a typical
day is rolling in around 7, working their</text>
    <text start="1022.85" dur="5.359">tails off getting all this stuff set up and
being there until 7 or 8 o&amp;#39;clock at night.</text>
    <text start="1028.209" dur="7">So it&amp;#39;s a machine. I&amp;#39;m really lucky in that
I&amp;#39;m number 5 or 6, I&amp;#39;m down on the call sheet,</text>
    <text start="1035.87" dur="7">I might be in 8, 9 scenes in the whole episode,
so I get maybe two days off a week and not</text>
    <text start="1042.98" dur="5.229">even, don&amp;#39;t even work full days when I work.
So for me it&amp;#39;s, like I said it&amp;#39;s super easy.</text>
    <text start="1048.209" dur="4.901">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: And you guys, everyone here has done
a lot of projects during the season and in</text>
    <text start="1053.11" dur="4.39">between the seasons, so everybody gets to
do a lot of different projects. Like, I think</text>
    <text start="1057.5" dur="5.419">you&amp;#39;ve all did about 5 movies over the break,
all of you. Various ways.</text>
    <text start="1062.919" dur="2.911">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I think you did the most.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: We all worked a lot.</text>
    <text start="1065.83" dur="4.15">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Yeah, it gives you time because
it&amp;#39;s a big, because we have an ensemble cast</text>
    <text start="1069.98" dur="5.75">it gives us time and there, our show runner,
the network, they&amp;#39;re really, they really let</text>
    <text start="1075.73" dur="7">us go do other things and work around our,
allow our schedules to be flexible in that</text>
    <text start="1082.95" dur="3.819">way. And every time, don&amp;#39;t you think? Every
time you go on and do something else do a</text>
    <text start="1086.769" dur="4.861">movie or work on something else, you come
back, their crews, they&amp;#39;re never as tight</text>
    <text start="1091.63" dur="3.56">as Parks&amp;#39; crews.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah, I got to, maybe we&amp;#39;re being</text>
    <text start="1095.19" dur="6.829">we&amp;#39;re well whatever, it&amp;#39;s true. Which is that
we shoot really fast and because it&amp;#39;s mockumentary</text>
    <text start="1102.019" dur="4.351">style, we never really know where the cameras
are and there&amp;#39;s not a lot of waiting around</text>
    <text start="1106.37" dur="6.49">for cameras and lighting and stuff. And everybody&amp;#39;s
on, on, on screen most of the time. So like</text>
    <text start="1112.86" dur="4.37">you never know when you&amp;#39;re going to be talking
or someone&amp;#39;s going to improvise, so you never</text>
    <text start="1117.23" dur="5.429">have that thing that you see in films where
I&amp;#39;m off camera giving Adam lines, like that</text>
    <text start="1122.659" dur="5.941">never happens. If we&amp;#39;re doing a scene, we
just do it together over and over again which</text>
    <text start="1128.6" dur="2.72">you get kind of used to and it&amp;#39;s really great,
I think, for comedy.</text>
    <text start="1131.32" dur="4.339">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah, I remember I came in late to
the show and they were already up and running</text>
    <text start="1135.659" dur="4.601">when I started and I remember my first day.
I came and did a scene with you and Nick [chuckles]</text>
    <text start="1140.26" dur="6.169">and we just did the scene, like, five times
and then we were done with the scene rather</text>
    <text start="1146.429" dur="5.931">than doing it 20 times and taking a break
and doing it another 20. There&amp;#39;s cameras all</text>
    <text start="1152.36" dur="5.61">over and they just capture everything and
I couldn&amp;#39;t believe how quick it was. It&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="1157.97" dur="3">really fun that way, I think.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: It was also sometimes the cameras</text>
    <text start="1160.97" dur="4.02">that they have the spy shots and so you don&amp;#39;t
actually know even know where the cameras</text>
    <text start="1164.99" dur="6.059">are. That can be, we joke around that we like
spy shots because it just makes your acting</text>
    <text start="1171.049" dur="4.25">look better. [giggles] But because it&amp;#39;s this
long lens and it just, but it is cool to do</text>
    <text start="1175.299" dur="7">scenes in rooms where nobody&amp;#39;s in there but
you. It feels, like, real sexy. OK.</text>
    <text start="1183.17" dur="3.869">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: There&amp;#39;s a real intimacy to it, you
know what I mean?</text>
    <text start="1187.039" dur="2.961">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Shut up.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: No, it&amp;#39;s like a connection with like.</text>
    <text start="1190" dur="6.519">I&amp;#39;ll talk about it at the hangout. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: But I&amp;#39;m like Chris, I feel like</text>
    <text start="1196.519" dur="6.37">a normal day for Amy is probably a lot different.
Because normally, I feel like the girls have</text>
    <text start="1202.889" dur="7">to come, you know, especially on Monday&amp;#39;s
like 5:30 in the morning, really early and</text>
    <text start="1211.75" dur="3.759">usually I walk in and I see you and you&amp;#39;re
there and you&amp;#39;re never late and I&amp;#39;m always</text>
    <text start="1215.509" dur="1.471">late.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I&amp;#39;m always a little; I&amp;#39;m a little</text>
    <text start="1216.98" dur="3.96">bit late sometimes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Really?</text>
    <text start="1220.94" dur="1.03">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I&amp;#39;m like ten minutes late, it&amp;#39;s a
problem.</text>
    <text start="1221.97" dur="5.379">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Well, I&amp;#39;m always early and I
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Wait I just thought you said.</text>
    <text start="1227.349" dur="6.011">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Well, whatever. [laughter] Sometimes
I get in really early and I don&amp;#39;t talk to</text>
    <text start="1233.36" dur="5.399">anyone for as long as I can. And I usually
go in my trailer and stare at myself in the</text>
    <text start="1238.759" dur="7">mirror and think about my choices and my regrets.
[laughter] I just, yeah, that&amp;#39;s how a day</text>
    <text start="1246.97" dur="3.789">starts.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah, I&amp;#39;ll see Aubrey in the morning</text>
    <text start="1250.759" dur="7">and I&amp;#39;ll say &amp;quot;Hi ,Aubrey.&amp;quot; And she&amp;#39;ll be like
&amp;quot;Aubrey&amp;#39;s dead. April&amp;#39;s here now.&amp;quot;</text>
    <text start="1258.429" dur="2.96">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: It&amp;#39;s really cool stuff; we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
    <text start="1261.389" dur="2.28">about it in the hangout.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: That&amp;#39;s hangout stuff.</text>
    <text start="1263.669" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s hangout stuff. This is Google
talk. We want to open up this part of the</text>
    <text start="1271.159" dur="4.201">Google talk to let you talk to see if anybody
has any questions that they would like to</text>
    <text start="1275.36" dur="4.779">ask us before we go into the hangout, which
is when things are really going get down and</text>
    <text start="1280.139" dur="2.801">dirty.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: We are so hyping up this hangout.</text>
    <text start="1282.94" dur="3.27">[laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: We should change into pajamas for</text>
    <text start="1286.21" dur="4.03">the hangout. OK, so yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Presenter: Yeah, I&amp;#39;ll start off with a</text>
    <text start="1290.24" dur="2.74">question and then you can approach the mic
as you have questions as well.</text>
    <text start="1292.98" dur="2.26">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Announcer: So I wanted, one of the real</text>
    <text start="1295.24" dur="4.439">highlights of Parks and Rec, are the behind
scenes characters, the birds, the murals on</text>
    <text start="1299.679" dur="4.561">the wall, like, how did those go about, how
have they developed, any interesting anecdotes</text>
    <text start="1304.24" dur="3.799">about that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah, that is such a credit to Mike</text>
    <text start="1308.039" dur="4.571">Schur and Greg Daniels and the writers that
all that world that Pawnee world exists and</text>
    <text start="1312.61" dur="5.429">that we bring people back, like Joan Callamezzo,
who is our kind of TV personality, and Perd</text>
    <text start="1318.039" dur="5.571">Hapley who is our hapless television news
reporter. People kind of come in and out of</text>
    <text start="1323.61" dur="7">the world and they come back a lot. One of
the new characters that I just particularly</text>
    <text start="1331.149" dur="6.681">like that came back, that is back again this
season, is Ethel Beavers is like the court,</text>
    <text start="1337.83" dur="5.4">kind of, stenographer and she&amp;#39;s the one that
last season told Leslie that Ben loved her</text>
    <text start="1343.23" dur="4.949">because she just read back the transcript.
And she&amp;#39;s the, and those are the kind of the</text>
    <text start="1348.179" dur="4.431">people that when they show up everyone&amp;#39;s like
&amp;quot;Ethel Beavers is here!&amp;quot; And we like to think</text>
    <text start="1352.61" dur="5.549">that the audience thinks that too, so. That
those kind of, there&amp;#39;s so many characters</text>
    <text start="1358.159" dur="2.75">like that. Like who are people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Like Kyle</text>
    <text start="1360.909" dur="3.49">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Kyle&amp;#39;s a funny one because I feel</text>
    <text start="1364.399" dur="7">like he&amp;#39;s the guy at the shoe shine stand
that, that is only character that is below</text>
    <text start="1372.97" dur="5.439">Jerry, I think, [laughter] that is in the
social hierarchy of it all. But he was funny</text>
    <text start="1378.409" dur="4.73">because he, we I didn&amp;#39;t know he was coming
back and he just said like one line and they</text>
    <text start="1383.139" dur="4.071">kept bringing him back and back and how he&amp;#39;s
got like this whole thing with Jerry. And</text>
    <text start="1387.21" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s, so it&amp;#39;s kind of fun when you see someone
over and over again.</text>
    <text start="1390.57" dur="2.739">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yeah, we haven&amp;#39;t seen Kyle for a while.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I ran into him at Sharky&amp;#39;s the other</text>
    <text start="1393.309" dur="1.56">day. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Did you smack him?</text>
    <text start="1394.869" dur="6.221">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah, I ignored him.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: And it&amp;#39;s really, what&amp;#39;s great about</text>
    <text start="1401.09" dur="3.689">episodic, especially a show like this, Dean
Hall and I don&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;ve ever given</text>
    <text start="1404.779" dur="4.48">him a shout out but he deserves a lot of credit.
He&amp;#39;s a head editor and also directs a lot</text>
    <text start="1409.259" dur="7">of the episodes and his voice is really a
large part of Parks and Rec&amp;#39;s comedy. And,</text>
    <text start="1417.47" dur="5.589">I think, because it&amp;#39;s always evolving you
go from one episode to the next and as one,</text>
    <text start="1423.059" dur="3.541">episodes play, writers are still in the room
creating things, so a lot of the guys that</text>
    <text start="1426.6" dur="5">you see come back they come back because they
made Dean laugh in the editing room. And so</text>
    <text start="1431.6" dur="7">that Kyle stuff makes them laugh, or the,
oh who, who recently just played, she&amp;#39;s like</text>
    <text start="1440.649" dur="7">the super straight-laced Christian conservative.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Darlene Hunt who plays Marcia Langman,</text>
    <text start="1448.649" dur="6.971">who&amp;#39;s kind of the uptight society for parents
and social people and people together and</text>
    <text start="1455.62" dur="4.35">whatever and she&amp;#39;s always protesting the sexy
stuff and she comes back in an episode we</text>
    <text start="1459.97" dur="3.61">just did and it&amp;#39;s great to see her back. And
all the crazy talents people we use a lot</text>
    <text start="1463.58" dur="6.339">of them because they show up at the meeting
a lot. And we had great, you know, we always,</text>
    <text start="1469.919" dur="7">we&amp;#39;ve been really lucky to have such great
people come join our show, cast-wise and guest</text>
    <text start="1477.71" dur="6.429">cast-wise and last season we had Louis C.
K. come back and Kathryn Hahn and Paul Rudd.</text>
    <text start="1484.139" dur="4.67">And this season, we just did, you saw on the
clip, Jon Glaser comes and plays a really</text>
    <text start="1488.809" dur="7">uptight councilman named Councilman Jan, who
gets gets jams things up. And we have a lot</text>
    <text start="1496.049" dur="6.901">of other good people coming down. Lucy Lawless
is with us now, playing a possible love interested</text>
    <text start="1502.95" dur="4.339">for Ron. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Lucy Lawless was Xena warrior princess</text>
    <text start="1507.289" dur="2.831">if you don&amp;#39;t know, she&amp;#39;s
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: And still is to my mind.</text>
    <text start="1510.12" dur="2.059">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Still is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Yeah</text>
    <text start="1512.179" dur="6.151">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: One of our writers, Harris Wittels,
comes back as animal control a lot which is,</text>
    <text start="1518.33" dur="2.079">always super funny.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s right, that&amp;#39;s right.</text>
    <text start="1520.409" dur="4.431">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: so those guys earn it, they get
laughs and that&amp;#39;s why they come back.</text>
    <text start="1524.84" dur="2.85">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Question?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #1: On the same note, as far as guest</text>
    <text start="1527.69" dur="3.66">stars go, is there any actor you would love
to come onto the show? Jason Statham, maybe,</text>
    <text start="1531.35" dur="2.669">someone like that, just come on there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Do you know Jason Statham? [laughter]</text>
    <text start="1534.019" dur="6.5">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #1: I wish.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;d be sweet. Only if he&amp;#39;s, if</text>
    <text start="1540.519" dur="6.41">we call him the Transporter. Well I&amp;#39;ve been
very vocal about my dream would be to have</text>
    <text start="1546.929" dur="5.281">Bill Murray, be on in any way, just because
I think he would, well, because he&amp;#39;s my comedic</text>
    <text start="1552.21" dur="5.27">hero and because I think he would fit in Pawnee
some how. We have a mayor on our show that</text>
    <text start="1557.48" dur="4.64">we talk about a lot that we&amp;#39;ve never seen
that would be my dream to have him play that.</text>
    <text start="1562.12" dur="4.279">Anybody else that you guys?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: I really want Dave Matthews to be</text>
    <text start="1566.399" dur="3.581">on just so that I could, so that Andy could
meet him and cry. [laughter] I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
    <text start="1569.98" dur="2.29">how it happens.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: That would be great.</text>
    <text start="1572.27" dur="3.879">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That would be great.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: If he gets on and plays with Mouse</text>
    <text start="1576.149" dur="3.441">Rat. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Oh God, that would be Andy&amp;#39;s dream,</text>
    <text start="1579.59" dur="4.709">can you imagine? Or maybe like Darius Rucker,
or like Eddie Vedder, or just someone like</text>
    <text start="1584.299" dur="4.38">that who&amp;#39;s just like was a big 90s iconic
rocker, that would be sweet.</text>
    <text start="1588.679" dur="4.21">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: I really like, like Rosie Perez
to be like my aunt.</text>
    <text start="1592.889" dur="1.76">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yessss!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: That would be sweet.</text>
    <text start="1594.649" dur="4.64">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Or like someone really likes spicy
and Latina to come and be one of my family</text>
    <text start="1599.289" dur="3.11">members.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: To be your Tia?</text>
    <text start="1602.399" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Yeah. That&amp;#39;s right. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Oh my God, I love you. And Adam, what</text>
    <text start="1610.009" dur="2.821">about you?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I don&amp;#39;t know. We&amp;#39;ve had some great</text>
    <text start="1612.83" dur="5.199">ones, so far this year; we&amp;#39;ve had some senators
come in when we&amp;#39;re in DC which was really</text>
    <text start="1618.029" dur="0.88">great.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That right.</text>
    <text start="1618.909" dur="5.801">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: That was a real experience. The four
of us were in DC together and it was a real</text>
    <text start="1624.71" dur="5.049">amazing experience working with them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: If you are watching the Google talk</text>
    <text start="1629.759" dur="6.41">and you are at minute 40 and you don&amp;#39;t know
this, our show premiers on September 20 and</text>
    <text start="1636.169" dur="7">we go to visit April and Ben in DC. I have
a feeling if you&amp;#39;ve watched this long then</text>
    <text start="1643.85" dur="0.449">you know that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah.</text>
    <text start="1644.299" dur="5.301">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Because if you don&amp;#39;t know of the show,
why the [whispers]fuck would be watching this.</text>
    <text start="1649.6" dur="4.959">But anyway we go and visit we visit Ben&amp;#39;s
character and we have some senators come visit</text>
    <text start="1654.559" dur="3.171">us, too. OK question over here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #2: Oh yes, in the first seasons The</text>
    <text start="1657.73" dur="3.64">Pit was a really big part of the show and
I was just curious like do you guys miss it,</text>
    <text start="1661.37" dur="4.47">or are you glad you don&amp;#39;t have to go to The
Pit anymore anything like that? [Amy and Aubrey</text>
    <text start="1665.84" dur="5.14">laugh]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: The Pit is was emblematic of Leslie&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="1670.98" dur="6.539">futile attempts to try to make change, so
it&amp;#39;s changed slowly. Now, it&amp;#39;s not actually</text>
    <text start="1677.519" dur="6.41">a pit, now it&amp;#39;s a grassy field that we go
to. And we have events on this field. But,</text>
    <text start="1683.929" dur="4.541">yes, in the beginning, the first, the first
thing I ever shot for the show was a promo</text>
    <text start="1688.47" dur="7">in the pit with trash swirling around me and
Aziz Ansari was like &amp;quot;Hey, I found a bra!&amp;quot;</text>
    <text start="1695.679" dur="4.6">like in the Pit and it was like &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going
build a park.&amp;quot; It was just dusty and it was</text>
    <text start="1700.279" dur="6.541">super hot and I remember thinking &amp;quot;Oh my God,
I hate the pit.&amp;quot; So and a lot of us fell into</text>
    <text start="1706.82" dur="3.979">the Pit many times, too. You fell into the
Pit you used to live in the Pit. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="1710.799" dur="5.651">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: I lived in the pit. That was the
worst. [Adam laughs] It&amp;#39;s out in the valley,</text>
    <text start="1716.45" dur="5.37">it got really hot out there and I&amp;#39;d come home
and have like dirt in my eyes from the Pit.</text>
    <text start="1721.82" dur="6.62">I was like &amp;quot;Fuck the Pit!&amp;quot; But it&amp;#39;s really,
it was a great, a mine for comedy which is</text>
    <text start="1728.44" dur="2.539">great, but, boy, it was just not comfortable
to be in it. It was super gross.</text>
    <text start="1730.979" dur="4.78">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: I think you may find some stuff happening
this season at the Pit. The Pit&amp;#39;s not gone</text>
    <text start="1735.759" dur="7">away. It&amp;#39;s like our hatch. [laughter] Oh my
God, I finally got some reaction out of this.</text>
    <text start="1743.379" dur="4.97">[laughter] Now I know what Google likes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Smoke monster</text>
    <text start="1748.349" dur="5.731">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #3: Obviously all you guys are very
funny, but who on the cast would you say is</text>
    <text start="1754.08" dur="5.799">the funniest and, on the flip side, who is
the most serious about their craft?</text>
    <text start="1759.879" dur="5.441">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Well, that&amp;#39;s hard to say. I&amp;#39;m going
to say Pratt&amp;#39;s the funniest.</text>
    <text start="1765.32" dur="1.58">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Yeah, I agree.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Yeah</text>
    <text start="1766.9" dur="5.109">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: I&amp;#39;m going to say I&amp;#39;m the most serious
about my craft. It&amp;#39;s kind of both.</text>
    <text start="1772.009" dur="3.121">[Inaudible]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: So there you go.</text>
    <text start="1775.13" dur="3.12">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Next question
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Next question</text>
    <text start="1778.25" dur="4.33">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #4: I know he wasn&amp;#39;t able to make
it today but Michael Schur actually went to</text>
    <text start="1782.58" dur="4.76">my high school and graduated with my sister,
so if he was here, do you think he&amp;#39;d remember</text>
    <text start="1787.34" dur="6.539">her? [laughter] And give her a shout out?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: What&amp;#39;s your sister&amp;#39;s name?</text>
    <text start="1793.879" dur="3.89">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #4: Robin Dinowitz, of course
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK, I&amp;#39;m going to ask ask him about</text>
    <text start="1797.769" dur="3.671">her, I&amp;#39;m sure he would, he&amp;#39;s a very very
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: He just yelled into the computer.</text>
    <text start="1801.44" dur="7">[laughter] No, he doesn&amp;#39;t. Sorry, so sorry.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I I&amp;#39;m wondering,Sir, if graduated</text>
    <text start="1808.96" dur="7">with your sister is a euphemism?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #4: I hope it is, yes. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="1817.23" dur="6.85">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Magna cum laude doing on your sister
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Magna cum louder</text>
    <text start="1824.08" dur="3.069">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: [laughs] OK, yeah, I don&amp;#39;t need groans
from you.</text>
    <text start="1827.149" dur="3.28">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #5: Thank you guys so much for coming
love the show. Just wondering what is the</text>
    <text start="1830.429" dur="3.691">biggest way in which each of you differs from
your character?</text>
    <text start="1834.12" dur="5.659">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s a good question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Maybe we could answer for each</text>
    <text start="1839.779" dur="1.38">other.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK.</text>
    <text start="1841.159" dur="3.21">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: That&amp;#39;s really good. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Why?</text>
    <text start="1844.369" dur="5.67">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: That sounds fun and super personal.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Or not.</text>
    <text start="1850.039" dur="2.48">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK</text>
    <text start="1852.519" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Amy, how does Chris differ from Andy?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK. Well, I think Chris is a better</text>
    <text start="1860.83" dur="7">listener than Andy, because Andy doesn&amp;#39;t listen
at all. And Chris is a better listener and</text>
    <text start="1867.909" dur="7">he&amp;#39;s just much more put together than Andy
is. I think Andy is a little bit more handsome</text>
    <text start="1875.139" dur="4.811">than Chris.
[Laughter]</text>
    <text start="1879.95" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: And that&amp;#39;s something that Chris has
to kind of work through. But I would say that.</text>
    <text start="1890.36" dur="7">I would say that, I would say that Chris is
not as, like as, as checked out as Andy is.</text>
    <text start="1900.789" dur="5.671">Well, let&amp;#39;s hope so. [laughs] OK, Plaza you
answer for Adam.</text>
    <text start="1906.46" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: OK I think that Amy is funnier
and 
sexier than Leslie, you know, could ever imagine</text>
    <text start="1920.59" dur="3.949">being, ever.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Thank you, all I heard was sexier</text>
    <text start="1924.539" dur="6.23">so I&amp;#39;ll take it. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: OK, Adam, I&amp;#39;m going to answer for</text>
    <text start="1930.769" dur="7">you. I think, you are, you, oh my God, this
is going to so dirty and I just gotta stop</text>
    <text start="1938.279" dur="7">myself. No, no, no! I saw your reaction to
magna cum loudy. [laughter] I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
    <text start="1945.419" dur="7">there again. OK, no, what I think, [laughs]
no I think, you know Adam likes to drive barefoot</text>
    <text start="1953.619" dur="7">and he&amp;#39;s from Santa Cruz so he&amp;#39;s a lot more,
you&amp;#39;re much more like, you&amp;#39;re less tightly</text>
    <text start="1961.509" dur="7">wound, I think, than Ben is.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Bro, listen, if you&amp;#39;re wearing flip</text>
    <text start="1970.009" dur="7">flops and you&amp;#39;re driving a car it&amp;#39;s unsafe
to keep the flip flop on am I right? [audience</text>
    <text start="1977.029" dur="4.571">responds] [applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: No, OK, but why do you think it&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="1981.6" dur="4.409">OK to drive barefoot?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Who, how do you think people drove</text>
    <text start="1986.009" dur="3.41">before there were shoes?
[Laughter]</text>
    <text start="1989.419" dur="3.731">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s a good point. No that&amp;#39;s a good
point. OK.</text>
    <text start="1993.15" dur="6.999">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I&amp;#39;m going to say Aubrey and April,
for the first year that I was on the show</text>
    <text start="2000.149" dur="7">I didn&amp;#39;t think there was a difference. [laughter]
But now I, there really is two completely</text>
    <text start="2009.98" dur="6.499">different people. In what ways? I don&amp;#39;t know.
[laughter]</text>
    <text start="2016.479" dur="7">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: It&amp;#39;s, I mentioned, I said this earlier
to someone, it was, I don&amp;#39;t remember where,</text>
    <text start="2023.99" dur="6.86">some interview. [chuckles] No, I was talking
about Aubrey and obviously Andy and April</text>
    <text start="2030.85" dur="3.689">are married and we work very closely with
one another and I said that it&amp;#39;s a shame for</text>
    <text start="2034.539" dur="5.321">people like David Letterman and Jay Leno and
Conan O&amp;#39;Brien that they&amp;#39;ll never actually</text>
    <text start="2039.86" dur="6.84">get to meet Aubrey. And I think that&amp;#39;s the
case with a lot of people. Especially in this</text>
    <text start="2046.7" dur="4.24">kind of environment where it&amp;#39;s a press type,
this isn&amp;#39;t press, but you know it&amp;#39;s a situation</text>
    <text start="2050.94" dur="7">where you&amp;#39;re where you&amp;#39;re on. I think Aubrey&amp;#39;s
on a lot, a lot of the time and that and its,</text>
    <text start="2059.07" dur="4.78">she&amp;#39;s like Andy Kaufman or something you know.
She&amp;#39;s kind of, she would meet the president</text>
    <text start="2063.85" dur="5">and take it as an opportunity to do a bit,
you know. She would be like, I don&amp;#39;t know.</text>
    <text start="2068.85" dur="4.97">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: We went, well, yeah
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: I think she would you know she would</text>
    <text start="2073.82" dur="5.52">meet the president and see it as an opportunity
to do a bit. But for the lucky few people</text>
    <text start="2079.34" dur="4.2">who get a chance to know her, she&amp;#39;s totally
different than April. April&amp;#39;s a character</text>
    <text start="2083.54" dur="5.639">that&amp;#39;s sort of like, that likes to mess with
people and those are similarities obviously</text>
    <text start="2089.179" dur="6.531">because they are sort of, they are born out
of who Aubrey is. She likes to fuck with people</text>
    <text start="2095.71" dur="5.06">and get a rise out of people and make people
uncomfortable. And it&amp;#39;s amusing to her. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="2100.77" dur="7">And but apart from all that she&amp;#39;s very, very
caring and sweet and a good listener and would</text>
    <text start="2108.63" dur="4.37">be there for her friends in a heartbeat. And
that&amp;#39;s a really nice.</text>
    <text start="2113" dur="5.08">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yes, hear, hear,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: And also I have to say, Chris is</text>
    <text start="2118.08" dur="5.28">one of even though Andy is very stupid, Chris
is one of the smartest actors I&amp;#39;ve ever worked</text>
    <text start="2123.36" dur="2.13">with ever.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: We said he was the funniest.</text>
    <text start="2125.49" dur="2.54">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Right, but I&amp;#39;m saying he&amp;#39;s the
smartest.</text>
    <text start="2128.03" dur="3.09">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: And now he&amp;#39;s also the smartest.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Smartest.</text>
    <text start="2131.12" dur="2.78">[Applause]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Yes, question.</text>
    <text start="2133.9" dur="5.33">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Male #6: I was wondering how often do you
improvise and go off script during filming</text>
    <text start="2139.23" dur="2.56">and how often does that actually make it onto
the air?</text>
    <text start="2141.79" dur="5.01">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: We are lucky in our process, where
first of all our scripts are always great</text>
    <text start="2146.8" dur="5.22">and what you see 99% of it is what was written
in the script and then maybe 1 or 2% an episode</text>
    <text start="2152.02" dur="5.27">is stuff that we improvise. But we get to
improvise which sometimes is just enough.</text>
    <text start="2157.29" dur="3.12">Because you get to be like &amp;quot;Can I do my stupid
idea?&amp;quot; [giggles] And then you get to do it</text>
    <text start="2160.41" dur="4.63">and you&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;Oh you&amp;#39;re right that idea,
my idea&amp;#39;s stupid.&amp;quot; But we do, we get to do</text>
    <text start="2165.04" dur="4.57">what we call on set we call it a fun run which
is we do the scene until we have it and then</text>
    <text start="2169.61" dur="4.95">we get to do a version after we know it where
we kind of fool around. And every once in</text>
    <text start="2174.56" dur="7">a while, bits of it get on the show, or but
usually it&amp;#39;s longer and less funny than what</text>
    <text start="2181.8" dur="5.11">was written in the script. [laughter]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: And it&amp;#39;s only fun for us, it&amp;#39;s not</text>

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: &amp;quot;You saw it, thanks to us.&amp;quot;</text>
    <text start="2247.67" dur="4.72">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: And it was just a cool picture of
her on the computer watching him and Leslie</text>
    <text start="2252.39" dur="5.62">and Ben Skype a lot in the first couple of
episodes of Parks because they&amp;#39;re, you know,</text>
    <text start="2258.01" dur="4.33">away, they&amp;#39;re separated, so I thought that
was a cool image. I mean that would be amazing</text>
    <text start="2262.34" dur="7">if she would do it. She would be great.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Female #2: Great question, I had a kind</text>
    <text start="2272.17" dur="3.41">of follow up thing, is there any chance that
the Pawnee folk might take a roadtrip through</text>
    <text start="2275.58" dur="4.14">O.C. for Arrested Development or vice versa,
the Arrested Development crew visit Pawnee?</text>
    <text start="2279.72" dur="3.96">How would that play out?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Oh God, no! Well, let me ask you guys</text>
    <text start="2283.68" dur="2.96">this, what do you think we should do a crossover
with? What show?</text>
    <text start="2286.64" dur="5.15">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Male #7: Party down?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Amy: Party down, well we are, we are. Arrested,</text>
    <text start="2291.79" dur="3.46">yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Male #8: Gossip Girl</text>
    <text start="2295.25" dur="3.19">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Amy: Gossip, [laughter] we should go, we
should just be like</text>
    <text start="2298.44" dur="2.53">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Go to New York?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: We&amp;#39;d go to New York and well we would</text>
    <text start="2300.97" dur="5.899">be just horrible, like poorly dressed extras
in the back of a Gossip Girl scene.</text>
    <text start="2306.869" dur="4.561">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: We should do a crossover with Vampire
Diaries.</text>
    <text start="2311.43" dur="6.82">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Well, Ian Somerhalder, he looks like
Rob Lowe&amp;#39;s younger, he looks like Rob Lowe&amp;#39;s</text>
    <text start="2318.25" dur="3.32">son or brother.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: He does. [laughter]</text>
    <text start="2321.57" dur="4.84">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Wait a minute, Adam.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: I think I&amp;#39;ve stumbled onto something.</text>
    <text start="2326.41" dur="3.62">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: So we&amp;#39;ll get that going.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Presenter: So I wanted to close with one</text>
    <text start="2330.03" dur="4.21">final question then. So for people who watch
this show, ordinary viewers, is there any</text>
    <text start="2334.24" dur="5.41">one thing that most people overlook that you&amp;#39;d
like to point out to them, whether it&amp;#39;s like</text>
    <text start="2339.65" dur="4.52">an Easter egg, something subtle.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy and Adam: That&amp;#39;s a good question.</text>
    <text start="2344.17" dur="3.8">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chris: Is there something that people were
overlook?</text>
    <text start="2347.97" dur="3.8">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Presenter: That they may not see, like
some you know caricature in the background</text>
    <text start="2351.77" dur="7">is really a writer in the mural.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Well the the photos of all the councilmen</text>
    <text start="2361.5" dur="6.8">over the years in the hallway have some of
our writer producers up there. And</text>
    <text start="2368.3" dur="6.34">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: That&amp;#39;s a good one, yeah. We
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Morgan Sackett is up there, so is</text>
    <text start="2374.64" dur="3.59">Norm Hiscock who is a writer.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: Dan Gore</text>
    <text start="2378.23" dur="5.54">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: Dan Gore, Mike Schur, they&amp;#39;re all
up on this wall, which is-- Who else is up</text>
    <text start="2383.77" dur="3.32">there?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: There&amp;#39;s a lot of things in in the</text>
    <text start="2387.09" dur="5.55">Parks department, like when you walk by there
will be like this, like a beautiful statute</text>
    <text start="2392.64" dur="5.62">of like the founder of the town and his name
is Greg Daniels, stuff like that. But I don&amp;#39;t</text>
    <text start="2398.26" dur="3.43">know how much of it&amp;#39;s actually made it on
the air, those kind of things.</text>
    <text start="2401.69" dur="6.35">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Adam: It&amp;#39;s a great set to come and give
a tour to to people on because there&amp;#39;s so</text>
    <text start="2408.04" dur="4.54">much, do you, open up a drawer and it&amp;#39;s filled
with things that have been on the show and</text>
    <text start="2412.58" dur="5.16">just little bits of history all over it. It&amp;#39;s
very, kind of, it&amp;#39;s very real; it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
    <text start="2417.74" dur="3.63">real office.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Aubrey: Also if you ever see anything at</text>
    <text start="2421.37" dur="6">with April at her desk and you notice her
the many notebooks or papers, there&amp;#39;s usually</text>
    <text start="2427.37" dur="6.21">plenty of drawings of penises on, [laughter]
because usually when I&amp;#39;m at the desk and I&amp;#39;m</text>
    <text start="2433.58" dur="4.52">just writing or working in the background
I&amp;#39;m just drawing penises over and over.</text>
    <text start="2438.1" dur="4.73">&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Amy: There you go. That would be considered
an Easter egg right? [laughter]</text>
    <text start="2442.83" dur="4.73">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Presenter: I think so. So with that, Pawnee,
greatest town in America. Thank you for stopping</text>
    <text start="2447.56" dur="0.96">by at Google!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All: Thank you!</text>
